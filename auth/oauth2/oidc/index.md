# OpenID Connect

> [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
