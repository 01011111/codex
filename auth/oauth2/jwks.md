# JSON Web Key Set

[RFC7517](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517)

The JWKS is a set of keys containing the public keys used to verify any JWT issued by the authorization server and signed using an asymmetric signing algorithm.

This JWKS is accessible at a public endpoint so that clients can always get the latest set and verify the tokens.
